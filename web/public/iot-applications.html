    <h1>IoT Applications</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <pre>
      My name is Vishal Sharma. I am currently studying Software Engineering. I aim to become a Software Developer. I like to read books, watch films, and commit to any undertakings I have for each day. 
      The units I have studied previously are:

      •	Introduction to Programming
      •	Computer Systems
      •	Discrete Mathematics
      •	Engineering Physics
      •	Robotics Project
      •	Data Information & Management
      •	Data Capture Technologies
      •	Object Oriented Development
      •	Embedded System Development
      •	Data Structures and Algorithms
      •	Engineering in Society
      •	Sustainable Design
      </pre>

    <h1>Activity 1: IoT Applications</h1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <pre>
      IoT Applications are usually defined as the products or services which provide real-time communication and access of data with other devices over the internet to perform various functions. 
      IoT Applications can perform various tasks without human intervention. They can collect data as well as perform actions which can be based on the data collected. Today, they are widely used 
      in applications such as smart home, smart city, self-driving car etc. The primary features are:

      •	Real-Time Connectivity
      •	Security
      •	Dynamic Nature
      </pre>
    
    <h1>Activity 2: Smart Building</h1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <pre>
      Smart buildings are equipped with sensing, positioning, communication technologies and are integrated with algorithms to perform various actions comprising of functioning and maintenance 
      along with disaster management. These applications can include security and surveillance, climate control, water monitoring, and fire detection and safety. Smart-buildings are a move 
      towards self-sustaining architecture which ensures its maintenance without disturbing any usual activities. The primary features are:

      •	Security and Surveillance
      •	Climate control
      •	Sun facing solar panel system
      •	Burglary prevention
      •	Water monitoring      
      </pre>
      
    <h1>Activity 3: Control Interface</h1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <pre>
      Control Interface is a user-friendly interface which allows one to monitor and control remote environments. They allow observation of different environmental factors, instrumental 
      measurements, and sensor readings. Based on the observations, the user can manipulate the environment in a befitting manner. Examples of such interfaces are, home security, temperature 
      control, manufacturing chain management, etc. The primary parts needed are:

      •	Sensor modules
      •	Camera
      •	Raspberry pi (Microcontroller)
      •	LED screen with GUI      
      </pre>
